# All Stars

## Getting Started 

```
git clone
yarn install
yarn validate 
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo and add this line:

```
NODE_ENV=development
ESPN_API='http://site.api.espn.com/apis/v2/scoreboard/header?showAirings=true&contentorigin=espn&lang=en&region=us&contentorigin=espn&_ceID=4379198'
```

## Express API

```
yarn api
```

You can now hit the api locally here:

http://localhost:3001/api

## React App

```
yarn start
```

Your browser should open with the React app here:

http://localhost:3000/
